# Endterm Coding Submission  

## Overview  

This repository contains all the coding work completed during the Winter in Data Science (WiDS) 5.0 program.

Throughout the program, I worked on building a strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning, and finally implemented a content-based movie recommender system. All the work has been done using Jupyter Notebooks and is organized week-wise.
